  about: [
    "I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate transitioning into software engineering. My background is in converting ambiguous customer requirements into structured, tested and practical technical solutions, work that translates directly to building software.",
    "I bring a systems-oriented approach to problem solving: decomposing requirements, developing iteratively, analysing failures, validating against data and documenting the reasoning behind each decision. I'm currently building applications in Python and TypeScript.",
